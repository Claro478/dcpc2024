## How to use
- Fork the repository
- Make your changes in the essay.md file
  - **Make sure you add your name and topic before the `---`**
  - Remember Git is a versioning system:
    - You can commit as you go and describe your changes.
    - You can create a new branch to make modification
    - You can even receive suggestions by your peers
- You can make your changes through the GitHub interface but I recommend trying [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) so you can have a better editing experience.
- To submit your essay you can send us the link to your repository by email (we should be able to see the forks but just in case)
## Essay guidelines
