## How to use
- Fork the repository
- Make your changes in the essay.md file
  - Remember Git is a versioning system:
    - You can commit as you go and describe your changes.
    - You can create a new branch to make modification
    - You can even receive suggestions by your peers
- You can make your changes through the GitHub interface but I recommend trying [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) so you can have a better editing experience.
- To submit your essay you don't have to do anything I'll just have to see who forked the repository
