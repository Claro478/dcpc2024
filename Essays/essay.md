# Public Policies in support of Digital Commons

## Executive Summary

Digital commons -i.e. shared and collectively managed digital resources- are increasingly recognized as critical for innovation, digital sovereignty, and equitable technology access. Therefore, governments worldwide are exploring policies to sustain and expand digital commons. This brief gives an overview of requirements, options and examples of policies in Europe and beyond.

## Introduction: Why Digital Commons matter

Digital commons are open, non-rival, and non-exclusive digital resources like open-source software, datasets, and communication protocols, collaboratively governed by communities of "commoners." They foster economic innovation, digital sovereignty, and societal empowerment by enabling inclusive, open governance and co-created infrastructure ([Peugeot, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUN-HN-OlSg); [Frion, 2022](https://www.sciencespo.fr/public/chaire-numerique/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/DIGITAL-COMMONS-policy-brief-Louise-Frion.docx-2.pdf)).

However, their sustainability is challenged by funding, volunteer, trust and license issues.

| Challenge    | Description |
| -------- | ------- |
|Sustainable Funding |	Reliance on intermittent or donor-dependent funding models.|
|Activist Burnout|	Dependence on uncompensated volunteers for critical work. |
|Independence and Trust	| Balancing investments with community-centric governance.|
|Regulatory uncertainty | Incompatible licenses complicate resource ownership rights management, hindering development and protection. | 


## Public Policies in favor of Digital Commons

Successful public policies should address these challenges, e.g. through long-term funding, community engagement, legal clarity, and fostering collaboration:

|  Goal    | Explanation |
| -------- | ------- |
|Sustainability	| Establishing enduring funding mechanisms and governance.|
Community Engagement |	Ensuring resources are inclusive and responsive.|
Legal and Operational Clarity |	Preventing conflicts through clear frameworks.|
Innovation | Promoting collaboration across sectors for transformative impact.|


### Typology: Policies Supporting Digital Commons

The NGI Commons initiative provides a preliminary [overview of policy initiatives](https://baserow.io/public/grid/NCWBxIVEDFtrZlOBXO7GC_hIHtK-NhHqiD-hyMX9G5w) in support of Digital Commons.

The ensuing categorization provides somewhat of a 'toolkit for policy makers' to assess their options and possible ways forward:

|  Policy Goals    | Policy Instruments | Type of issuing authority | Targeted actors |  Funding   | Terminology |
| -------- | ------- |----------- | -------- | ------- |--------- |
|  Transparency & accountability, better policy making | Regulation   | Inter- / supranational organization | Civil society organization | Grants (fund given by a public authority for a specific public purpose)  | Digital Commons |
|  Reduction of costs and mutualisation of ressources  | Public funding |   National government (executive) | Private sector | Prizes (financial contribution given as a reward following a contest)  | Free Open Source Software / Open Source Software |
|  Sovereignty and security of technologies for governments, organizations and invdividual    | Capacity building, technical and legal assistance |  |  Public Institutions   |   | Open data |
|  Innovation and economic opportunities  | Promotion (information and communication dissemination)  |  | |     | Public Digital Goods/Infrastructure |
|  Competition and better level playing field | Partnerships for collaboration with public authorities |  |   |    | Open norms/Open standards/Open protocols |
|  Enforcement of digital rights: fundamental freedoms, privacy, consumer rights or labor rights  |  Public procurement |   |    |  | 
|  Improved access to immaterial resources and better dissemination of knowledge and culture   |  |  |    |  |


### Examples:

1. **EU-FOSSA project**: Enhancing security of critical open-source software through audits, bug bounty programs, hackathons, and community engagement.

2. **France’s "La Suite Numérique"**: Promoting interoperability and sovereign digital infrastructure by co-developing integrated public sectors tools with OSS Foundations​.

3. **Spain's Decidim**: Public funding to help grassroot activists who delevoped a model for participatory governance through OSS achieve a sustainable business model.


## Regional Dynamics

#### Europe: Policy Leadership
With the examples, Europe currently leads the regulatory and funding support for digital commons. Policies commonly emphasize sovereignty due to dependencies on global tech giants​, but also scientific, economic and political collaboration (e.g. through European Digital Infrastructure Consortia (EDICs)).

#### Americas: Open Government, Innovation and Open Internet
While [Brazil](https://www.opengovpartnership.org/news/independent-report-shows-brazils-13-year-commitment-to-openness/) is leading open government efforts, [Argentina's Technological Fund](https://stip.oecd.org/stip/interactive-dashboards/policy-initiatives/2023%2Fdata%2FpolicyInitiatives%2F14579) aims at fostering private sector innovation. North, the US foster open internet through the [Open Technology Fund](https://www.opentech.fund/about/values-principles/). 

#### Sub-Saharan Africa: Decolonizing Digital Infrastructure
Digital commons in the region are commonly framed as decolonizing tools of empowerment to address global inequities, e.g. by [promoting SDGs](https://www.afd.fr/en/carte-des-projets/mapping-digital-commons-sub-saharan-africa), especially in agriculture, health, and education​.

#### Asia: Taiwan’s g0v
[Taiwan's Gov-zero](https://g0v.tw/intl/en/) shows successful state-community collaboration, leveraging open data and participatory governance to enhance civic engagement and transparency​.

Equally, regional dynamics play out through terminology, with 'Digital Commons' commonly used in Europe emphasizing the shared governance of the resource, and use of 'Digital Public Goods/Infrastructure' associated with international cooperation and the context of SDGs.


## Policy Recommendations

1. Strengthen Cross-Border Collaboration
Promote mechanisms like EDICs to enable multinational governance and shared investment in digital commons​.

2. Adopt Flexible Funding Models
Combine public, private, and philanthropic funding sources to ensure sustainable financing while preserving independence​.

3. Support Capacity Building
Equip communities with the skills and tools to sustain digital commons, e.g. by training backup maintainers.

4. Improve Legal and Regulatory Frameworks
Expand clarity surrounding open-source licensing and enforce policies to protect commons from monopolization​​.

5. Foster Community-Driven Innovation
Support grassroots initiatives like g0v and Decidim in their expressed needs for bottom-up development while respecting community independence​​.


# Conclusion

With the omnipresence of Digital Commons in all areas of public life, supporting Commoning through public policies becomes essential.
By comparing regional approaches and identifying best practices, policymakers can create policies that balance innovation, inclusivity, and sovereignty. Europe’s regulatory frameworks, Africa’s decolonial strategies, and Asia’s participatory models offer valuable lessons and potential for future implementatios. At the same time, understanding and addressing Commoning challenges such as funding sustainability and governance alignment will continue to be a crucial task when employing Digital Commons for the public good.
